# Colored Tabs for Android


Colored Tabs is a concept app to explore aspects of Material design.
Story video content is displayed on a TextureView instead of SurfaceView. Considering SurfaceView is rendered in a separate window from the app, artifacts were clearly visible while scrolling in either direction.
Design created by iliketotouchinterfaces.com
App is available on Github.
